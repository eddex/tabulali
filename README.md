<p>Tabulali - Cardano wallet aggregator</p>
</h1>

Simple website to get an aggregated overview of all your Cardano wallets.
All data is stored locally in the browser.

## Development

To fetch data from the public [Koios](https://koios.rest) API, a proxy server is needed.

A simple implementation can be found here: [eddex/koios-proxy](https://github.com/eddex/koios-proxy).

Configure the proxy url in `src/services/KoiosClient.js`
