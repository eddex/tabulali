<p>Tabulali - Cardano wallet aggregator</p>
</h1>

A simple website to get an aggregated overview of all your Cardano wallets.

## üíª Development

Start the app: `npm start`

### Prerequisites

To fetch data from the public [Koios](https://koios.rest) API, a proxy server is needed.
The app tries to connect to `localhost:5001` if run locally.

A simple proxy server can be found here: [eddex/koios-proxy](https://github.com/eddex/koios-proxy).
You can configure the proxy url in `src/services/KoiosClient.js`, if you use a different proxy server.

### Deploy to GitHib pages

`npm run deploy`
